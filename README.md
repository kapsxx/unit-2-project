<!-- # Project - Replicating "rodanandfields.com"

The entire replication of the website is achieved using HTML and CSS. Also, in order to make it look more interactive, we have used DOM Manipulations and event listeners along with Javascript. We have tried to compile maximum number of concepts which have been taught to us in Masai School in a single project. The entire project comprises of 3 webpages entirely interactive and responisve.

***All the HTML files are attached along with CSS and Javascript files in the repository.*** -->
